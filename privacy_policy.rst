**Privacy Policy for Color Filter**

**Effective Date:** 2025-03-22

Thank you for using Color Filter ("the App"), developed by David Manthey ("we",
"us", or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles information 
when you use it.

**1. No Data Collection**

We **do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or usage information**
from you or your device. The app functions entirely offline regarding data 
handling.

**2. Permissions Explained**

To provide its core functionality, the App requires the following permissions:

- **Camera Permission (`android.permission.CAMERA`):**

  - **Purpose:** This permission is required solely to allow you to view the
    camera stream with an applied color filter or to determine the color of 
    part of the camera image.

  - **Usage:** Images captured using the camera are processed **locally on your 
    device** in real-time. These images are **not** collected, stored (by the
    app itself), or transmitted anywhere.

**3. Data Storage**

The App **does not store** any personal data, images, metadata, or usage 
statistics. 

**4. Data Transmission**

The App **does not transmit** any data (personal or otherwise) from your device
to us or any third party. All processing related to applying color filters
occurs entirely on your local device.

**5. Third-Party Services**

The Color Filter app does not integrate with any third-party services for 
analytics, advertising, or any other purpose that would involve data collection
or transmission.

**6. Children's Privacy**

The App is not directed towards children under the age of 13 (or the relevant
age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect any information from 
children. Since the App collects no data whatsoever, it inherently does not
collect information from children.

**7. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The 
notification will be in the form a git commit and posting the new Privacy
Policy at the same location as this one.

**8. Contact Us**
